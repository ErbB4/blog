# Topic of interest

sequential activation of **mental concepts** (cell assembly, Donald Hebb)
--> assembly sequences (a feedforward network of ccell assembly)

# How to build cell assemblies in a huge network?

## blueprint of the network

NE = 20,000
NI = 5,000
p_rand = 0.01 (less than 0.1)

## 10 cell assemblies
NE = 500
NI = 125
random connection (p_rc)

## feedforward connections between adjacency cell assemblies

**excitatory** neurons projection only

random connection (p_ff)
