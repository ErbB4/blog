# topic of interest

Intuition: brain should be **fully** connected, for its highly condensed property and interaction of collaterals.

Experience evidence: brain is **sparsely** connected, with a connection probability of $10\%$ in neocortex.

Question concerned: is the sparse connection an optimal setting (for information storage)?

# two hypotheses of information storage in the brain

## attractor states

A small group of neurons have higher firing rates compared to background activity.

This is also a widely-accepted mechanism in feedback network (recurrent network).
